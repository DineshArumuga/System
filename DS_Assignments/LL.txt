Create a list with 3 nodes having int data in single Linked list data : 100,200,300
Create a circular LL with 5 nodes having char data - vowels - a,e,i,o,u


1.Implement queue using LL
2.Remove alternate nodes in single linked list
3.Write a program to remove the node at particuar position in single linked list
4.program to count number of nodes in Singly Linked List
5.C program to swap two nodes in a singly linked list
6.Two or more linked lists merging. (with and without duplicates).
